    The PropertyEstimatorClient supports two main workflows: one where
    a PropertyEstimatorServer lives on a remote supercomputing cluster
    where all of the expensive calculations will be run, and one where
    the users local machine acts as both the server and the client, and
    all calculations will be performed locally.

    Warnings
    --------
    While the API of this class in now close to being final, the internals and implementation
    are still heavily under development and is subject to rapid changes.

    Examples
    --------

    Setting up the client instance:

    >>> from propertyestimator.client import PropertyEstimatorClient
    >>> property_estimator = PropertyEstimatorClient()

    If the PropertyEstimatorServer is not running on the local machine, you will
    need to specify its address and the port that it is listening on:

    >>> from propertyestimator.client import ConnectionOptions
    >>>
    >>> connection_options = ConnectionOptions(server_address='server_address',
    >>>                                                         server_port=8000)
    >>> property_estimator = PropertyEstimatorClient(connection_options)

    To asynchronously submit a request to the running server using the default estimator
    options:

    >>> # Load in the data set of properties which will be used for comparisons
    >>> from propertyestimator.datasets import ThermoMLDataSet
    >>> data_set = ThermoMLDataSet.from_doi('10.1016/j.jct.2016.10.001')
    >>> # Filter the dataset to only include densities measured between 130-260 K
    >>> from propertyestimator.properties import Density
    >>>
    >>> data_set.filter_by_property_types(Density)
    >>> data_set.filter_by_temperature(min_temperature=130*unit.kelvin, max_temperature=260*unit.kelvin)
    >>>
    >>> # Load initial parameters
    >>> from openforcefield.typing.engines.smirnoff import ForceField
    >>> parameters = ForceField('smirnoff99Frosst.offxml')
    >>>
    >>> request = property_estimator.request_estimate(data_set, parameters)

    The status of the request can be asynchronously queried by calling

    >>> results = request.results()

    or the main thread can be blocked until the results are
    available by calling

    >>> results = request.results(synchronous=True)

    How the property set will be estimated can easily be controlled by passing a
    PropertyEstimatorOptions object to the estimate commands.

    The calculations layers which will be used to estimate the properties can be
    controlled for example like so:

    >>> from propertyestimator.layers import ReweightingLayer, SimulationLayer
    >>>
    >>> options = PropertyEstimatorOptions(allowed_calculation_layers = [ReweightingLayer,
    >>>                                                                  SimulationLayer])
    >>>
    >>> request = property_estimator.request_estimate(data_set, parameters, options)

    Options for how properties should be estimated can be set on a per property, and per layer
    basis. For example, the relative uncertainty that properties should estimated to within by
    the SimulationLayer can be set as:

    >>> from propertyestimator.workflow import WorkflowOptions
    >>>
    >>> workflow_options = WorkflowOptions(WorkflowOptions.ConvergenceMode.RelativeUncertainty,
    >>>                                    relative_uncertainty_fraction=0.1)
    >>> options.workflow_options = {
    >>>     'Density': {'SimulationLayer': workflow_options},
    >>>     'Dielectric': {'SimulationLayer': workflow_options}
    >>> }

    Or alternatively, as absolute uncertainty tolerance can be set as:

    >>> density_options = WorkflowOptions(WorkflowOptions.ConvergenceMode.AbsoluteUncertainty,
    >>>                                   absolute_uncertainty=0.0002 * unit.gram / unit.milliliter)
    >>> dielectric_options = WorkflowOptions(WorkflowOptions.ConvergenceMode.AbsoluteUncertainty,
    >>>                                      absolute_uncertainty=0.02 * unit.dimensionless)
    >>>
    >>> options.workflow_options = {
    >>>     'Density': {'SimulationLayer': density_options},
    >>>     'Dielectric': {'SimulationLayer': dielectric_options}
    >>> }

    The gradients of the observables of interest with respect to a number of chosen
    parameters can be requested by passing a `parameter_gradient_keys` parameter.
    In the below example, gradients will be calculated with respect to both the
    bond length parameter for the [#6:1]-[#8:2] chemical environment, and the bond
    angle parameter for the [*:1]-[#8:2]-[*:3] chemical environment:

    >>> from propertyestimator.properties import ParameterGradientKey
    >>>
    >>> parameter_gradient_keys = [
    >>>     ParameterGradientKey('Bonds', '[#6:1]-[#8:2]', 'length')
    >>>     ParameterGradientKey('Angles', '[*:1]-[#8:2]-[*:3]', 'angle')
    >>> ]
    >>>
    >>> request = property_estimator.request_estimate(data_set, parameters, options, parameter_gradient_keys)
    >>>
