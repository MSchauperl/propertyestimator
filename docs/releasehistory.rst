Release History
===============

Releases will eventually follow the ``major.minor.micro`` scheme recommended by
`PEP440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#final-releases>`_, where

* ``major`` increments denote a change that may break API compatibility with previous ``major`` releases
* ``minor`` increments add features but do not break API compatibility
* ``micro`` increments represent bugfix releases or improvements in documentation

All early releases however will simply recieve a ``micro`` version bump regardless of
how major the changes may be.
