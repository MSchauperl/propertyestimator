==================
Property Estimator
==================

The property estimator is a distributed framework from the `Open Forcefield Consortium <http://openforcefield.org>`_
for storing, manipulating, and computing measured physical properties from simulation data.

.. warning:: This framework is still in **pre-alpha** and under heavy development. Although all steps
             have been taken to ensure correctness of the code and the results it produces, the authors
             accept no liability for any incorrectness any bugs or unintended behaviour may cause.
